# Tokenized Commercial Real Estate Debt

## Overview

This project implements a blockchain solution for tokenizing commercial real estate debt, creating a more liquid, transparent, and accessible market for property-backed loans. By converting traditional mortgage debt into tradable tokens, the platform democratizes access to real estate investments while maintaining security and compliance.

## Key Components

### Property Verification Contract
Validates and maintains records of the legal status, condition, and valuation of properties serving as collateral. This creates an immutable record of property information that underpins the tokenized debt.

### Loan Securitization Contract
Converts traditional mortgage debt into standardized, tradable tokens that represent fractional ownership of the underlying loan. This enables smaller investors to participate in commercial real estate debt markets with lower capital requirements.

### Payment Distribution Contract
Manages the collection of loan payments from borrowers and automatically distributes interest and principal to token holders based on their ownership percentage. This smart contract ensures transparent and timely payments.

### Default Management Contract
Handles the procedures and protocols for non-performing loans, including notification to stakeholders, management of grace periods, and execution of recovery processes. This provides clear, predefined procedures for loan defaults.
